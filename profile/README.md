"A Minecraft Movie" is a live-action adaptation of the popular sandbox video game Minecraft, directed by Jared Hess. The film follows four misfits—Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers), and Dawn (Danielle Brooks)—who are unexpectedly transported to the Overworld, a cubic realm fueled by imagination. To return home, they must collaborate with Steve (Jack Black), an expert crafter, and navigate challenges posed by creatures like Piglins and Zombies. ​

Released in theaters on April 4, 2025, "A Minecraft Movie" achieved remarkable box office success, grossing $162.75 million domestically and $313.2 million worldwide in its opening weekend. This performance set a new record for video game movie adaptations, surpassing previous benchmarks. ​

The film has also sparked a unique cultural phenomenon. Audiences, particularly Gen Z and Gen Alpha, have turned screenings into interactive experiences reminiscent of cult classics like "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." Fans engage by shouting key lines, singing along, and even throwing popcorn during fan-favorite moments, notably the "Chicken Jockey" scene featuring Jason Momoa's character facing a zombie riding a chicken. ​

Director Jared Hess expressed his excitement over the film's success, acknowledging the enthusiastic theater reactions and the viral trends on social media platforms like TikTok. He described the experience as a "bonanza," highlighting the communal joy and engagement it has fostered among viewers. ​

The film's success has led to considerations for dedicated screenings to accommodate different viewer needs, such as autism-friendly or fan-interactive showings, ensuring that all audiences can enjoy the unique cinematic experience. ​
